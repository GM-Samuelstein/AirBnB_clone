<code><h3>HTML</h3></code>   <code><h3>CSS</h3></code>  <code><h3>Front-End</h3></code>

This is the second stage of the AirBnB Clone Project. In the first stage, <a href="https://github.com/beryl452">my partner</a> and I created a command interpreter to manage our AirBnB objects. The second stage of the project is all about making the objects come alive by creating a simple, static HTML page, styled with CSS. This stage does not include JavaScript, and data is not loaded from anything.
